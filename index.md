# Laura Guzman-Rincon

I am a research fellow at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick, funded by the [Warwick-Wellcome Translational Fellowship](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/wellcome-translation/). I have previously held postdoctoral research positions funded by the [KEMRI-Wellcome Trust](https://kemri-wellcome.org/) and the [JUNIPER consortium](https://maths.org/juniper/). During the pandemic, I was a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling Operational sub-group, [SPI-M-O](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-pandemic-influenza-subgroup-on-modelling), a sub-group of SAGE that gives expert advice to the UK government.

My research focuses on the development of Bayesian hierarchical models, primarily applied to epidemiology and other real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in the application of Gaussian processes to analyse genetic, temporal, and spatial data, and developing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to enhance the implementation of these models.

Recently, I have worked on developing a modelling framework to estimate and produce short-term forecasts of growth rates during an epidemic.

I have also worked with colleagues in Astrophysics to use Gaussian processes to estimate the initial configuration of the cataclysmic variable HS 0218+ 3229.

## On-going projects
- Methods for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using sequences submitted in GISAID. Project developed during my work with the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust with Mike Mwanga, George Githinji and James Nokes.
- Detection of infectious disease outbreaks using epidemiological and genetic data: case-study of Campylobacter infections in England. Project developed during my PhD with my supervisors Simon Spencer and Noel McCarthy. (See my PhD thesis [here](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/153848/1/WRAP_Theses_Guzman_Rincon_2020.pdf)).
