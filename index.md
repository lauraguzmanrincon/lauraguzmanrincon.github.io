# Laura Guzman-Rincon

I'm a research fellow at the [Mathematics Insitute](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/) of the University of Warwick, funded by the Warwick-Wellcome Translational Fellowship. I was previously appointed as a researcher funded by the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust. During the pandemic, I worked as a researcher funded by the JUNIPER consortium and was a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling Operational sub-group, [SPI-M-O](https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/scientific-pandemic-influenza-subgroup-on-modelling), sub-group of SAGE that gives expert advice to the UK government.

My research focuses on the development of Bayesian hierarchical models, primarily applied to epidemiology and other real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in the application of Gaussian processes to analyse genetic, temporal, and spatial data, and developing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to enhance the implementation of these models.

In my most recent work, I worked on developing a modelling framework to estimate and produce short-term forecasts of growth rates during an epidemic.

My most recent work aims to produce estimates and short-term forecasts of the growth rates during an epidemic. During my PhD, I worked in outbreak detection using spatial-temporal and genetic data for Campylobacter infections.

I have also worked with colleagues in Astrophysics to use Gaussian processes to estimate the initial configuration of a cataclysmic variable.

## On-going projects
- Methods for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern using sequences submitted in GISAID. Project developed during my work with the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust with Mike Mwanga, George Githinji and James Nokes.
- Detection of infectious disease outbreaks using epidemiological and genetic data: case-study of Campylobacter infections in England. Project developed during my PhD with my supervisors Simon Spencer and Noel McCarthy. (See my PhD thesis [here](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/153848/1/WRAP_Theses_Guzman_Rincon_2020.pdf)).

## Other projects I have worked on
